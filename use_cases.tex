\begin{comment}

* Select Game Type, Select Scenario overlap and should be merged
  Resume game could extend or be merged with a start game use case

* We have save game but not quit. Is save game related enough to quitting
  to extend or be merged with quitting?

* Should Choose Leader be merged with a general "Select Unit(s)"?

* Should enemy player be an actor in combat?

* Display Random Event & Player order could use more User Actions
  to make it use-casey. "Actor: System" is the sort of thing that would give
  Dr. Jeffery a heart-attack

* Invasion can happen outside of normal player movement
  And the player might not be able to prevent it.

* Is confirm important enough to be it's own use case? Or should it just be
  part of the steps of other use cases?

* Some things don't fit nicely into the two-column format. do they need tweaking?

* View Character Statistics should maybe be expanded to any unit type, and include
  any current effects such as current Movement Points.

* Should Advance and Retreat extend Movement? Extend Combat?

  Overall I feel like we could have more extending, to make an interesting diagram

* are we missing any big use-cases? Do any need to be tweaked

Need plan of action to have diagram and associated descriptions ready on thursday
